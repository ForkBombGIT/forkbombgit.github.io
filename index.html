                        your mayhem. Abductions grant experience to the ship providing random upgrades varying from increased defense to extended ray length. As the player continues to abduct humans, the military will gradually increase their forces,
                        beginning at policemen and finishing with helicopters. UFO Mayhem is a 2D side-scroller developed by myself and a team of three other people. The game was developed in approximately 24 hours over the span of two weeks. The game
                        was made for the Skills Canada competition held in Mississauga, Ontario. We managed to place 1st, bringing us our second gold as a game development team. </p>
