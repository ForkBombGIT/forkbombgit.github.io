                        <p>UFO Mayhem puts the player in the seat of an alien spaceship to cause havoc to a small, densely populated city. The main objective of the game is to abduct as many people as possible, as the human's military tries to put a stop
                            to your mayhem. Abductions grant experience to the ship providing random upgrades varying from increased defense to extended ray length. As the player continues to abduct humans, the military will gradually increase their forces,
                            beginning at policemen and finishing with helicopters. <br><br> UFO Mayhem is a 2D side-scroller developed by myself and a team of three other people. The game was developed in approximately 24 hours over the span of two weeks.
                            The game was made for the Skills Canada competition held in Mississauga, Ontario. We managed to place 1st, bringing us our second gold as a game development team.

                        <p>Chaos lets players take control of a dual wielding skeleton inside of a treacherous dungeon. Players can pick up new spells and equipment to enhance their character to fight off various enemies ranging from clowns and dolls to
                            disappearing ghosts and giant insects. The dungeon is randomly generated, so each player will be different from the previous! <br><br> Chaos is a 2D top-down dungeon crawler developed by myself and a team of three other people.
                            The game was developed for a game making competition held at Sheridan College with over 120 participants. Our team managed to bring home gold for this game, which was a great pay off for the countless hours put into this game.
