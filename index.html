						Hey, my name is Eros Di Pede, and I'm a third-year Computer Science student studying at Carleton University in
						Ottawa, Ontario. I am working towards a Bachelor in Computer Science, with a specialization in Game Development,
						and a minor in Entrepreneurship.
						I'm an aspiring indie game developer and hope to release a game with a pal of mine very soon. Other than game
						development, I also have a strong interest in mobile and web development. In my free time, I work on various
						ongoing programming projects,
						watch TV shows, practice karate, and take pictures. I'm currently working on a few projects including, an Android
						app called Scrambled Eggs, and a computer game called Iron Fusion Force, and some other small projects that you
						can check out below!

								<div class="panel-body text-justify " style="text-justify: inter-character">
									<p>
										Highlighters is a simple tile swapping puzzle game that was developed in about a month. 
										The game revolves around the matching of "Charms" with color coresponding "Bombs". 
										A match occurs when a Bomb matches with two or more bombs or tiles. 
										The objective of the game is to create matches as quickly as possible, while preventing the screen from filling up 
										with game pieces.

								<h3>UFO Mayhem</h3>
								<h4> 2016 </h4>
								<div class="panel-body text-justify" style="text-justify: inter-character">
									<p>
										UFO Mayhem puts the player in the seat of an alien spaceship to cause havoc to a small, densely populated
										city. The main objective of the game is to abduct as many people as possible, as the human's military tries
										to put a stop to your mayhem. Abductions
										grant experience to the ship providing random upgrades varying from increased defense to extended ray length.
										As the player continues to abduct humans, the military will gradually increase their forces, beginning at
										policemen and finishing with
										helicopters.
										<br><br> UFO Mayhem is a 2D side-scroller developed by myself and a team of three other people. The game was
										developed in approximately 24 hours over the span of two weeks. The game was made for the Skills Canada
										competition held in Mississauga,
										Ontario. We managed to place 1st, bringing us our second gold as a game development team.

									random games or work through a questionnaire that will generate a game for them based on their answers.
